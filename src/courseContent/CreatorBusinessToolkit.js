They have a clear brand. A clear voice. People KNOW what they're about.

- But only ONE talks about affordable drugstore dupes for dark skin tones with your specific humor and vibe

2. "What could I talk about for 30 minutes without notes?"
   - Not what you SHOULD talk about. What you COULD.
   - That passion is what makes content feel authentic

3. "What problem do I solve that I WISH someone had solved for me?"
   - This is the secret sauce

Wrong. Here's why:

When you're a "lifestyle creator," brands see you as... generic. Forgettable.

When you're "the affordable fashion girl who shows dark skin women how to look expensive on a budget"? NOW you're memorable.

Brands don't want to reach everyone. They want to reach THEIR customer. Be the obvious choice for a specific audience, and you'll never struggle for deals again.

Real talk: I've turned down more deals since niching down than I ever received when I was trying to do everything.`

I went from begging brands for free products to getting PAID partnerships within 3 months. My engagement rate went from 2% to 8%. Why? Because the people following me were actually interested in what I was posting.

My first paid deal after niching down? $400 for a single Instagram Reel. The brand said: "We love that you specifically speak to our target customer."

That's the power of being known for something.`,

The person running a brand's Instagram? They probably can't even approve a $50 collab. They're a social media manager, not a decision maker.

[ON SCREEN: Show Instagram bio → highlight partnership email]

Here's how to find the RIGHT person:

1. Check their Instagram bio for "partnerships@" or "collab@" emails
2. Go to their website → look for Contact, Press, or Partnerships page
3. Use LinkedIn to find their "Influencer Marketing Manager" or "PR Manager"
4. Google "[Brand name] influencer program" - many have application forms
5. Check their press page - often lists PR contacts

❌ "I think I would be a great fit for your brand..."

First, always check the brand's Instagram bio. Many brands list a specific email for partnerships:

- collab@brand.com  
- pr@brand.com
- creators@brand.com

3. CONTENT QUALITY - Can you create professional-looking content they can reuse?

4. NICHE AUTHORITY - Are you THE person in your space?

I've seen creators with 5K followers charge more than creators with 50K because they nail these factors.

[ON SCREEN: Pricing Calculator]

BASE RATE = (Follower Count × 0.01) × Engagement Multiplier

Engagement Multipliers:
- Under 2%: × 0.75
- 2-4%: × 1.0
- 4-6%: × 1.5
- 6%+: × 2.0

Then add:
- Story series (+30%)
- Usage rights (+50-100%)
- Exclusivity (+25-50% per month)
- Rush delivery (+25%)
- Whitelisting (+50%)

EXAMPLE: 20K followers with 5% engagement
Base: 20,000 × 0.01 = $200
Engagement multiplier (5% = 1.5x): $300
Add usage rights (+50%): $450
Add Stories (+30%): $585

See? Math removes the emotion. You're not "asking for too much" - you're pricing based on value.`

WRONG: "Um, I was thinking maybe like $300? But I'm flexible..."

RIGHT: "For this deliverable, my rate is $500. That includes [specifics]. Let me know if that works with your budget."

Confidence matters. If YOU don't believe your rate is fair, neither will they.

And here's a secret: brands expect negotiation. Quote slightly higher than your minimum so there's room to meet in the middle.
